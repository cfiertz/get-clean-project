**These variables were obtained from the original variables contained in the features.txt file within the UCI HAR Dataset through the following process:**
1. The features were read in and assigned to the variable "names"
2. The names were then applied to as labels for the variable "X"
3. The original variable names were cleaned by removing the parentheses and spelling out the initial word "time" or "frequency" for each variable
4. After several other transformation detailed in the README, the variables containing "mean." or "std." were identified and extracted.
5. The variable "id" was created by using the cross-product of the activity names and the subject ID numbers to create a unique instance for each subject-activity pairing.
